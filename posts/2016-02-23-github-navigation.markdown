title: Github Navigation
---

Recently, I learned some of the life-changing keyboard shortcuts
that are available at Github's website. These are the sort of thing
that can make you the envy of your friends as you speedily navigate
through source code repos without needing to touch your mouse.

My favourites are:

- `s`, which puts focus on the search bar;
- `g n`, which opens your notifications;
- `g p`, which opens your pull requests;
- `t`, which activates the file finder for a project;
- `l`, which takes you to a given line in a file
- `w`, which switches to a new branch; and,
- `g c`, which takes you to the project root.
