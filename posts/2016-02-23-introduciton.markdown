title: Introductions

I'm a Ruby developer at On The Beach, which is based in Manchester,
England. I'll be using this blog to discuss ruby, web development, and
interesting aspects of software development and computer science. In
particular, I'd like to get better at object oriented design, git and
rails, so hopefully by researching and writing posts, I can use this
blog to do exactly that. I'm also a keen functional programmer, so
will probably discuss that as well.
